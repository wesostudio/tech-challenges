# Weso Studio | Real Technical Situation

Recreate the X database tables with their real attributes and relations between them.

## Tables:

- User
- Posts
- Favourites
- Reposts (quoted or not)
- Followers (and followed)

You can use the raw SQL language you rather, or an ORM, like Prisma, Sequelize, Apollo, etc.
